# Visualizing_CNN_Filters_and_Feature_Maps_with_VGG16
This project visualizes filters and feature maps of the VGG16 convolutional neural network model. The filters from the convolutional layers and the corresponding feature maps for an input image are extracted and displayed, providing insight into how the model processes and learns features from images.
